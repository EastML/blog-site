    DESCRIPTION: "This page is for my hobbies, other than coding [consider there is a whole page for that haha]. You may ask, 'Isn't coding your job?' While that is true, the only reason I have a job as a software developer is because it was my hobby first. I'll save the rest for the actual coding page, so without further ado... onto the hobbies!",
    RUNNING: {
        TITLE: "Running 🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️",
        DESCRIPTION: "I've been a runner from high-school onward. I was never part of an official running or track team [Though I did try to make a running group. Unfortunately it didn't last through the winter ⛄], but have always tried to press myself to run. I think running gets a bad wrap because, at least in my friend circle, people think of it as boring, but for me its a great meditative exercise. Once I lock into a pace, I can clear my head, and find peace in the chaos of it all.",

    DIGIMON: {
        TITLE: "The Digimon Trading Card Game 👾",
        DESCRIPTION: "A pretty large part of my childhood was dedicated to playing the Pokemon Card Game and Yugioh. Those hobbies continued until around the beginning of high school, where I got really deep into fighting games. Fast-foward to the beginning of COVID, I was looking to get into a new card game after nearly ten years, and the Digimon Card Game which had just come out in Japan seemed like an interesting fit, so I picked up a starter deck and dived right in. By complete happenstance, a week later, a friend of mine reached out to me, asking about the production work I had done with fighting games [more on that below] and if I could do something similar with the Digimon Card Game project his team at work had just received from Bandai. Since then I've become a project manager, commentator, content creator, and even bigger fan of the game. You can find links to my work of the above items below:"
