        TITLE: "Running 🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️",
        DESCRIPTION: "I've been a runner from high-school onward. I was never part of an official running or track team [Though I did try to make a running group. Unfortunately it didn't last through the winter ⛄], but have always tried to press myself to run. I think running gets a bad wrap because, at least in my friend circle, people think of it as boring, but for me its a great meditative exercise. Once I lock into a pace, I can clear my head, and find peace in the chaos of it all.",
        FEATS: "🏅 Here are some of the feats i'm most proud of 🏆",
